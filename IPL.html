      <h2>What is IPL Hair Removal?</h2>
      <p>
        IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) hair removal is a safe, non-invasive treatment designed to reduce 
        unwanted hair growth. Using controlled pulses of broad-spectrum light, IPL targets the pigment 
        (melanin) in hair follicles, gradually reducing their ability to regrow hair.

      <h2>What to Expect</h2>
      <p>
        During the session, a handheld device delivers controlled light pulses to the treatment area. 
        Most clients describe the sensation as a mild snap on the skin, similar to a rubber band flick. 
        Sessions are quick, and downtime is minimal—making it easy to fit into your routine.
      </p>
      <p>
        For best results, multiple sessions are recommended, as hair grows in different cycles.

      <h2>Aftercare</h2>
      <p>
        To achieve optimal results and keep your skin healthy, avoid direct sun exposure and tanning beds 
        before and after treatments. Apply sunscreen regularly and follow your therapist’s aftercare advice.
